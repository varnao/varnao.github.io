        Hello! My name is <strong>Valeria Arnao</strong>, I'm from Los Angeles,
        and I'm a third-year Computer Science student at Cal Poly SLO. On my
        campus, I serve as the Graphic Designer for the Women In Software &
        Hardware club and am also part of the Cal Poly Scholars program. Outside
        of academics, I love watching movies, making music, reading, and working
        out!
