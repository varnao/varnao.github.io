        Hello! My name is <strong>Valeria Arnao</strong>, I'm from Los Angeles,
        and I'm a third-year Computer Science student at Cal Poly SLO. On my
        campus, I serve as the Graphic Designer for the
        <em>Women In Software & Hardware club</em> and am also part of the
        <em>Cal Poly Scholars</em> program. Outside of academics, I love
        watching movies, making music, reading, and working out!
