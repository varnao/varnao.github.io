            Hello! My name is <strong>Valeria Arnao</strong>, I'm from Los
            Angeles, and I'm a third-year Computer Science student at Cal Poly
            SLO. On my campus, I serve as the Graphic Designer for the Women In
            Software & Hardware club and am also part of the Cal Poly Scholars
            program. Outside of academics, I love watching movies, making music,
            reading, and working out!
